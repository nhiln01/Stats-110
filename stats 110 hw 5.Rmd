1.a. Random assignment is impossible because you cannot assign the babies with different mothers. 
  b. We cannot extend our samples results to the general population. It is not an experimental study.
  
2.
```{r}
Blood = read.table("C:/Users/nhing/Stats 110 Dataset/Blood.txt" , header=TRUE)
```
  a. 
```{r}
boxplot(Blood$SystolicBP ~ Blood$Overwt, ylab = "Blood pressure", xlab = "Weight group")
```
  
  b. 
  **Group 0**: mean: 136.3155, standard deviation: 27.26852, sample size: 187.
  
  **Group 1**: mean: 144.3670, standard deviation: 25.07864, sample size: 109.
    
  **Group 2**: mean: 153.1814, standard deviation: 27.81397, sample size: 204.
```{r}
tapply(Blood$SystolicBP, Blood$Overwt, mean)
tapply(Blood$SystolicBP, Blood$Overwt, sd)
tapply(Blood$SystolicBP, Blood$Overwt, length)
```
  c. The standard deviations shown in part b are roughly equal, so it is appropriate to conduct a test of variance.
  d. Systolic $BP_{i,k} = \mu + \alpha_{k} + \epsilon_{i,k}$
  
  **Null hypothesis**: $\alpha_0 = \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 0$
  
  **Alternate hypothesis**: at least one of $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2$ is not equal to $0$.
  
  e. **Null hypothesis**: The mean blood pressure of the three weight groups are the same.
  
  **Alternate hypothesis**: At least one group's mean  blood pressure is different from the others.
  
  f. F test statistic: $19.02$. P-value: $1.1 \cdot 10^{-8}$. Since the p value is small, we reject the null hypothesis and claim that at least one of $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2$ is not equal to $0$.
```{r}
mod = aov (SystolicBP ~ as.factor(Overwt), data=Blood)
summary(mod)
```
  g. 
```{r}
TukeyHSD(mod, ordered = T)
```
```{r}
plot(TukeyHSD(mod, ordered = T))
```
  
  h. Systolic $BP_{i,j,k} = \mu + \alpha_k + \beta_j + \epsilon_{k,j}$
  i. 
```{r}
mod2 = aov (SystolicBP ~ as.factor(Overwt)+as.factor(Smoke), data=Blood)
summary(mod2)
```
  j. **Null hypothesis**: $\beta_0 = \beta_1 = 0.$
  
  **Alternate hypothesis**: at least one of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ is not equal to $0$.
  
  Since the p value is $0.000163$, which is small, we reject the null hypothesis and claim that at least one of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ is not equal to $0$.
  
  k. Systolic $BP_{i,k,j} = \mu + \alpha_k + \beta_j + \gamma_{k,j} + \epsilon_{k,j}$
  
  l. **Null hypothesis**: $\gamma_{k,j} = 0.$ for $k = 0,1,2$ and $j = 0,1$.
  
  **Alternate hypothesis**: $\gamma_{k,j} \neq 0$ for $k = 0,1,2$ and $j = 0,1$.
  
  Since the p value is $0.583614$, which is large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
```{r}
mod3 = aov (SystolicBP ~ as.factor(Overwt)+as.factor(Smoke)+as.factor(Overwt)*as.factor(Smoke), data=Blood)
summary(mod3)

3.a. Response variable: amount eaten by rats; two factors: hormones (leptin or insulin) and sex (male or female).
  
  b. Hormones: experimental (2 levels); Sex: observational (2 levels).
  
  c. Based on the results, there exists an interaction term between the two factors since both sexes have different responses to both hormones.
  
4.a. Response variable: test scores; two factors: Noise level (high or low) and Hyperactive diagnosis (yes or no)

  b. Noise level: experimental (2 levels); hyperactive diagnosis: observational (2 levels).
  
  c. Based on the results, there is no interaction between the two factors.
  
5.a. Mean of men: $(12 + 14)/2 = 13.$
  
  Mean of women: $(17 + 16)/2 = 16.5.$

  Mean of treadmill: $(12 + 17)/2 = 14.5.$

  Mean of rowing machine: $(14 + 16)/2 = 15$

  $$\mu = (13 + 16.5)/2 = (14.5 + 15)/2 = 14.75$$

  b. $\alpha_1 = 14.5 - 14.75 = -0.25$
  
  $\alpha_2 = 15 - 14.75 = 0.25$
  
  c. $\beta_1 = 13 - 14.75 = -1.75$
  
  $\beta_2 = 16.5 - 14.75 = 1.75$
  
  d. $\gamma_{11} = 12 - 14.5 - 13 + 14.75 = -0.75$
  
  $\gamma_{12} = 17 - 14.5 - 16.5 + 14.75 = 0.75$
  
  $\gamma_{21} = 14 - 15 - 13 + 14.75 = 0.75$
  
  $\gamma_{22} = 16 - 15 - 16.5 + 14.75 = -0.75$
